# Resturant Tip
It is an example of Fuzzy System which gives output of what the Resturant tip should be based on the Service and Food quality provided by the user.

# Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANIFS)
Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy System is integrated with Gradient Descent System to find the optimal values of the parameters and then predict the value of the function provided( Here fuction predicted is x^2 ). It is also possible to use Least Square Approximation method instead of Gradient Descent in that case we would need to be more careful with setting up the matrices.
